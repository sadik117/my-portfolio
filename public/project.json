    "description": "The Healthy Food Recipe Book is an interactive web application designed to inspire users with a variety of nutritious recipes. It allows users to browse, add, update, and delete recipes. Each recipe includes detailed ingredients, preparation steps, images, and like counts. The platform is ideal for home cooks, food bloggers, and anyone passionate about healthy eating.",
    "projectLore": "The vision behind this project is to create a vibrant and user-friendly space where users can share and discover healthy recipes easily. In future updates, I plan to implement advanced filtering by category, nutrition facts display, and social sharing features. Enhancing the like system, introducing meal planning tools, and integrating user profiles for tracking personal recipe collections are also on the roadmap. These improvements will turn the Recipe Book into a comprehensive, health-focused culinary platform.",

    "lackings": ["Missing users profile showcase", "Limited personalization"],
    "challenge": "A major challenge was implementing the like system in a way that prevented users from liking the same recipe multiple times. Managing this required checking user identity and recipe state while optimizing MongoDB queries. Ensuring real-time feedback without performance delays also pushed me to optimize my API design and client-side state management."

    "description": "Virtual Book House is a dynamic MERN stack web application that allows users to manage and explore a digital bookshelf. Users can add books, write and edit reviews, track their reading status (Want-to-Read → Reading → Read), and upvote books by others. The platform fosters reading engagement and builds a social experience around books.",
    "projectLore": "My goal with Virtual Book House is to create a complete reading companion that not only helps users manage books but also engages them through community features like upvotes and reviews. In upcoming updates, I plan to add reading statistics visualizations, better review sorting, and optional reading reminders. These enhancements will create a more immersive and data-driven user experience.",

    "lackings": ["Limited analytics", "Basic review sorting", "No dark mode toggle"],
    "challenge": "The most complex feature was the reading tracker system. It required careful design to ensure users could only update their own books' statuses while maintaining real-time visual feedback. Balancing user permissions, accurate PATCH requests, and maintaining UI consistency across devices demanded thoughtful architecture and testing."
